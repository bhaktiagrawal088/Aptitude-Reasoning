There are **three** major types:
1. **Direct Relationship Questions** – Based on simple statements.
2. **Coded Relationship Questions** – Uses symbols to define relations.
3. **Puzzle-Based Questions** – Requires arranging family members based on clues.

**Answer:** X is the father of Y, and Y is the mother of Z → X is the grandfather of Z.

### 3. Puzzle-Based

### **2. Symbolic Relationships**

In these types of questions, relationships are represented using symbols.

#### **Example 1:**

If:  
- `A + B` → A is the brother of B  
- `C - D` → C is the father of D  
- `E ÷ F` → E is the sister of F  
- `G × H` → H is the mother of G  

**Which of the following means that N is the mother of O?**

i) L + M ÷ N – O  
ii) L – M × O ÷ P  
iii) N ÷ M × L ÷ O  
iv) M + L ÷ O × N  

**Solution:**
- `M + L` → M is the brother of L.
- `L ÷ O` → L is the sister of O.
- `O × N` → N is the mother of O.
- **Answer:** M + L ÷ O × N.

### **3. Mixed or Miscellaneous Questions**

These involve multiple relationships in a family structure.

#### **Example 1:**

A family consists of 6 members: **P, Q, R, X, Y, Z**. The relationships are:
1. Q is the son of R, but R is not the mother of Q.
2. P and R are a married couple.
3. Y is the brother of R, X is the daughter of P.
4. Z is the brother of P.

**Questions:**
1. Who is the brother-in-law of R?
2. How many female members are there in the family?
3. How is Q related to X?
4. How is Y related to P?

**Solution:**
- **Brother-in-law of R?** → Z (P’s brother).
- **Number of females?** → 2 (P and X).
- **Q’s relation to X?** → Brother.
- **Y’s relation to P?** → Brother-in-law.

## **Diagram Representation Techniques**

### **1. Facing Directions**

| Facing Direction | Left | Right |
|------------------|------|-------|
| North | West | East |
| South | East | West |
| East | North | South |
| West | South | North |

- Inside Facing → **Clockwise = Left**, **Counterclockwise = Right**
- Outside Facing → **Clockwise = Right**, **Counterclockwise = Left**

### **2. Family Tree Representation**

#### Example of a simple family tree:

```
       Grandfather
         |
  -----------------
  |               |
Father         Uncle
  |
  P   <->   R (Married)
  |            |
  X (Daughter)  Q (Son)
```

Use symbols:
- **`+`** = Male
- **`-`** = Female
- **`<->`** = Married
- **`|`** = Parent-Child Relationship
