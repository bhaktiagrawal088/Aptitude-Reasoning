# Logical Reasoning: Series

## Introduction
Series-based questions are common in logical reasoning assessments. These questions involve identifying the pattern in a given sequence and predicting the missing elements.

There are three main types of series problems:
1. **Numerical Series**
2. **Alphabetical Series**
3. **Alphanumeric Series**

## 1. Numerical Series
In numerical series, a sequence of numbers follows a specific pattern based on arithmetic or geometric principles. The challenge is to identify the pattern and determine the next number.

### Common Patterns in Numerical Series:

#### i) Addition or Subtraction (Arithmetic Progression - AP)
- Each number is obtained by adding or subtracting a fixed value.
- Example: `8, 10, 12, 14, ?` (Next: `16`)

#### ii) Multiplication or Division (Geometric Progression - GP)
- Each number is multiplied or divided by a constant.
- Example: `9, 18, 54, 216, ?, 6480` (Next: `864`)

#### iii) Squares or Cubes
- The numbers follow the pattern of squares or cubes of integers.
- Example: `8, 27, 64, 125, ?, 343` (Next: `216`)

#### iv) Prime or Composite Numbers
- The series consists of prime or composite numbers.
- Example: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ?` (Next: `13`)

#### v) Factorial or Fibonacci
- The series follows factorials (n!) or Fibonacci sequences.
- Example: `21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ?, 377` (Next: `233`)

#### vi) Miscellaneous Patterns
- These series may involve breaking down numbers or reversing sequences.
- Example: `41, 93, 165, 257, 369, ?` (Next: `491`)

## 2. Alphabetical Series
These series involve letters following a logical sequence based on their position in the English alphabet.

### Common Alphabetical Series Patterns:

#### i) Position-based Addition/Subtraction
- Example: `CEH, ?, OQT, UWZ` (Next: `IKN`)

#### ii) Alternating Pattern
- Example: `BDA, FHE, ?, NPM` (Next: `JLI`)

#### iii) Reverse Order or Skipping Letters
- Example: `HFD, NLJ, ??O, XVT` (Next: `QPS`)

#### iv) Multiple Step Shifts
- Example: `AEFG, BHIJ, ?, DNOP` (Next: `CKLM`)

---

## 3. Alphanumeric Series
These involve a mix of numbers, letters, and sometimes symbols.

### Common Alphanumeric Series Patterns:

#### i) Combination of Numbers and Letters
- Example: `2E2, 1H9, 1K6, 1N3, ?` (Next: `1Q0`)

#### ii) Increasing/Decreasing Letters with Numbers
- Example: `H8, L12, O15, S19, ?` (Next: `V22`)

---

## Special Approaches to Solving Series Problems

### 1. Reverse Numbering of Letters
Each letter has a position:
- A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26
- Reverse: A = 26, B = 25, ..., Z = 1
- The sum of forward and reverse positions is always **27**.
- Example: `A-1-26 (1+26=27), B-2-25 (2+25=27) ... Z-26-1 (26+1=27)`

### 2. Pyramid Approach
If a pattern isn’t clear, try breaking it into a **pyramid structure** to identify hidden relationships.

# Logical Reasoning: Series Questions & Answers

## Numerical Series

### 1. Find the missing number:
**Question:**  
`3, 6, 11, 18, ?, 38`

**Pattern:**  
The differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2:
- \(6 - 3 = 3\)
- \(11 - 6 = 5\)
- \(18 - 11 = 7\)
- **Next difference: \(9\), so \(18 + 9 = 27\)**
- \(38 - 27 = 11\)

**Answer:** `27`

---

### 2. Identify the pattern and complete the series:
**Question:**  
`2, 4, 8, 16, ?, 64`

**Pattern:** Each number is multiplied by 2:
- \(2 × 2 = 4\)
- \(4 × 2 = 8\)
- \(8 × 2 = 16\)
- **\(16 × 2 = 32\)**
- \(32 × 2 = 64\)

**Answer:** `32`

---

## Alphabetical Series

### 3. Complete the letter series:
**Question:**  
`B, E, H, K, ?`

**Pattern:** Each letter moves forward by 3 places:
- B → E (+3)
- E → H (+3)
- H → K (+3)
- **K → N (+3)**

**Answer:** `N`

---

## Alphanumeric Series

### 4. Find the next term:
**Question:**  
`A2, C4, E8, G16, ?`

**Pattern:**  
- Letters: A, C, E, G (**increasing by 2**) → **I**  
- Numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16 (**doubles each time**) → **32**  

**Answer:** `I32`
